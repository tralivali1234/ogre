The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes.\r\n\r\n* [API documentation](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/api/1.10/)\r\n* [Doxygen based Manual](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/api/1.10/manual.html)\r\n\r\nNote that this is not a git mirror of the [OGRE Project on bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre/) but a fork with a diverged codebase. This is denoted by the git suffix in the version number. [See here for the differences to the bitbucket version](https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre/blob/master/git-ChangeLog.md).\r\n\r\n## Try it\r\n* [Online Emscripten Demo](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/emscripten/)\r\n* Ubuntu Snap package: `sudo snap install ogre`\r\n\r\n## OpenGL RenderSystem Comparisons\r\nCurrently only the legacy GL RenderSystem is able to pass all VTests from the suite. This is partly due to the tests relying on Cg which the other RenderSystems do not support. Still it is considered the gold standard. See below how the GLES2 and GL3Plus RenderSystems behave in comparison:\r\n* [GL3Plus vs GL](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/gl_status/TestResults_GL3Plus.html)\r\n* [GLES2 vs GL](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/gl_status/TestResults_GLES2.html)\r\n* [GLES2 vs GL3Plus](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/gl_status/TestResults_GLES22.html)\r\n\r\n# Useful Add-Ons\r\nBeneath the OGRECave umbrella you can also find some useful OGRE Add-Ons like\r\n* [Blender Exporter](https://github.com/OGRECave/blender2ogre)\r\n* [Syntax highlighting for Ogre Scripts for Atom](https://github.com/OGRECave/language-ogre-script)\r\n* [Particle Universe](https://github.com/OGRECave/particleuniverse)\r\n",
